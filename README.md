# Employee Salary Analysis using Python
The core objective of this project is to analyze the Employee_Salaries.csv dataset. It focuses on "Net Pay," a custom-engineered metric calculated by aggregating base salary, overtime, and longevity pay to represent total actual compensation.

#### The application features a Tkinter-based GUI that allows users to generate four distinct analytical visualizations at the click of a button :
*Gender Pay Analysis*: A bar graph comparing the average net pay of men and women to identify potential pay gaps.

*Compensation Density*: A Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) plot showing the probability distribution and most probable range of net pay .

*Salary Correlation*: A scatter plot with an overlaid regression line to illustrate the trend between base salary and total net pay .

### 📊 Key Insights Derived

Equity Monitoring: The tool visually identifies if compensation is symmetrical or if specific genders favor higher or lower pay ranges.

Trend Analysis: Through regression, the app highlights how overtime and longevity impact the overall relationship between base pay and final earnings.

Workforce Concentration: The histogram reveals standard pay grades by identifying significant peaks in the distribution of base salaries.
