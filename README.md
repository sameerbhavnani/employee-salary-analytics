# Employee Salary Analysis using Python
The core objective of this project is to analyze the Employee_Salaries.csv dataset. It focuses on "Net Pay," a custom-engineered metric calculated by aggregating base salary, overtime, and longevity pay to represent total actual compensation.

The application features a Tkinter-based GUI that allows users to generate four distinct analytical visualizations at the click of a button :


Gender Pay Analysis: A bar graph comparing the average net pay of men and women to identify potential pay gaps.


Compensation Density: A Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) plot showing the probability distribution and most probable range of net pay .


Salary Correlation: A scatter plot with an overlaid regression line to illustrate the trend between base salary and total net pay .


Base Salary Distribution: A histogram showing the concentration of employees across different base salary brackets .

🛠️ Tech Stack

GUI Framework: Tkinter.


Data Manipulation: Pandas and NumPy.


Data Visualization: Seaborn and Matplotlib .

📊 Key Insights Derived

Equity Monitoring: The tool visually identifies if compensation is symmetrical or if specific genders favor higher or lower pay ranges.


Trend Analysis: Through regression, the app highlights how overtime and longevity impact the overall relationship between base pay and final earnings.


Workforce Concentration: The histogram reveals standard pay grades by identifying significant peaks in the distribution of base salaries.
