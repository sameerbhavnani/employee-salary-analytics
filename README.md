# employee-salary-analytics
Developed a Python-based suite to analyze 10k+ salary records via a custom Tkinter GUI. Using Seaborn and Matplotlib, I engineered statistical visualizations like KDE and scatter plots to uncover pay gaps and distribution trends. This tool transforms raw compensation data into actionable insights to ensure organizational pay equity.
